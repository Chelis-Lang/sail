# Roadmap

The project is built in waves. Each milestone ends with evidence: green gates,
conformance results and, where relevant, benchmark data. Work widens only after
the previous milestone is shown to work.

## Initial session (foundation): done, 2026-10-08

See `docs/reports/2026-10-08-bootstrap.md` for the evidence.

- **M0: Workspace and guardrails.** The crate skeleton from the charter, the fast
  CI tier, lints, the AI-authorship guard (hook, CI and agent config), docs, and
  ADRs 0001–0002. *Exit:* both CI jobs green on `main`, the guard rejects an AI
  trailer locally and in CI, then switch to PR mode.
- **M1: Survey and integration decision.** `docs/survey/` covers Verus↔Z3
  internals for the pinned release, prior art, corpus candidates and solver
  behaviour. The pinned Verus is installed via `cargo xtask fetch-verus`. *Exit:*
  an ADR on the integration point, backed by an empirical transcript.
- **M2: Faithful pass-through.**
  - `sail-smtlib`: a byte-faithful parser and printer.
  - `sail-session`: assertion stack, options and the logical state at each
    `check-sat`.
  - `sail-z3` (`sail-shim`): forwards every byte to the pinned Z3, with an
    observation-only tap and transcript capture.

  *Exit:* a toy crate verifies identically with and without the shim.
- **M3: Corpus, conformance, baseline and profile.**
  - Pinned corpus.
  - `sail-conformance` diffs plain Verus against Verus-with-shim.
  - `sail-bench` baseline and generated `docs/benchmarks.md`.
  - Query corpus from shim transcripts, with a profile of solver time per query
    and function and of seed stability.

  *Exit:* zero verdict or diagnostic differences in pass-through mode.
- **M4: Report.** Survey findings, the integration evidence, baseline and
  profile, conformance results, and open questions.

## Initial product: complete, 2026-10-09

Milestone M5 and `docs/reports/2026-10-09-initial-product.md` record the
completion decisions and full local acceptance. The owner kept the unknown
serving cap at 50%; the later research below remains deferred.

## M6: Live workspace verification and team caching (implemented)

This milestone implements a complete local developer and agent
workflow. Ordinary single-developer use needs no credentials, server setup,
account, or container. One verification worker runs by default.

1. **Managed workspace verification** ([#64](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/sail/issues/64)).
   Always invoke Cargo; retain complete successful per-target proof receipts in
   Sail-owned artifacts. Bind them to the exact verification context and actual
   artifacts. Return complete reports when Cargo reuses verified targets, and
   refresh missing or incompatible evidence.
2. **Persistent jobs, watch and MCP** ([#65](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/sail/issues/65)).
   Submit, inspect, follow and cancel verification across sessions. Watch the
   workspace and local path dependencies; distinguish current results from
   historical or superseded work. Result lookups stay responsive during runs.
3. **Optional HTTP team cache** ([#66](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/sail/issues/66)).
   Read and publish signed SMT entries over authenticated HTTPS, with an
   optional lightweight self-hosted service. Reader signing trust remains
   independent of transport authentication; remote failures cost misses.

Acceptance is retained in `docs/reports/2026-10-10-live-workspace.md`: complete
unchanged reports with zero verifier invocations, native CLI/MCP and recovery
checks, exact same-name library/binary solver inputs, full local corpus coverage,
and three-round secondary-platform resource measurements. Easy synthetic
fixtures show freshness overhead, not a general wall-time gain. Follow-ups are
safe freshness-cost reduction ([#69](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/sail/issues/69))
and an unresolved emulated verifier wait
([#68](https://github.com/Chelis-Lang/sail/issues/68)). No deadline or check was
relaxed to classify a failed attempt as success.

Exit evidence: unchanged eligible workspaces invoke no verifier and return
complete reports; edits and verification-context changes invalidate correctly;
job cancellation/restart/currentness work across CLI and MCP; a fresh remote
reader consumes verified signed replies and silence certificates. Run full
local gates and affected conformance, with three-round performance and resource
measurements. Long tests stay local-only; every required CI job remains below
ten minutes. Persistent Verus internals, solver pools, normalization, stack-only
keys and new SMT backends remain deferred.

## M7: Interactive proof engine and repair workflow (in progress)

The approved contract is [ADR 0027](decisions/0027-interactive-proof-engine-and-repair-workflow.md).

- Optional pinned source engine: retain one compiler callback for a focused
  check followed by independent full validation; reuse conservative prepared
  lowering without retaining compiler state across source revisions.
- CLI/MCP repair checks, failure evidence, saved named baselines and comparison.
- A separate live proof-event journal with revision-aware projection and
  cancellation/reconnect handling.
- Shared complete input observation and responsive job reads, addressing #69.

Exit: exact stock full-result/diagnostic conformance and cached-versus-fresh
solver bytes from the same compiler input (ADR 0027 amendment); full local corpus
and affected source tests; established reads below 200 ms p95 during active
verification; and at least **2× median improvement on each** of frozen
human-eval-verus and Vest repair catalogues in the local Linux container.
The owner will rerun reference measurements on a native Linux host later;
container emulation is labelled and does not block implementation. Three
rounds and spread are required. Batch-local preparation reuse is distinguished
from persistent reuse across edits. No successful focus is accepted before
complete current full validation. M7 remains incomplete until these gates pass.

### Current state

The experimental CLI/MCP workflow is implemented: exact-function repair checks,
separate focused/full evidence, resumable proof observations, failure explanation
and immutable baseline comparison. Persistent MCP readers and the Rust SDK
receive complete fresh service replies; decoded reuse grants no freshness or
proof authority. Start with [the walkthrough](proof-repair-walkthrough.md),
[the MCP guide](mcp.md) or [the SDK contract](result-client.md).

M7 is **not accepted**. The selected source baseline still lacks the required
physical preparation-memory bound. Corrective graph/decoder/observer candidates
remain unselected and require complete source qualification and genuine
previous-revision focus reuse. The complete frozen `777b86a`
[workspace gate](../bench/validation/m7-linux-gate-777-emulated-2026-10-11.json)
passes all 485 tests and the remaining gate steps. The complete
[solver attempt](../bench/validation/m7-linux-solver-777-emulated-2026-10-11.json)
passes the corrected classifier fixture and 36 other controls, but fails the
HTTP whole-session replay control: answers match the solver, yet the fresh
reader starts Z3 instead of using only signed remote replies/certificate.
The failed cache and signed files are retained; the cause is being diagnosed.
The independent frozen `f94bbda`
[native Linux CI run](../bench/validation/m7-linux-ci-f94-native-2026-10-11.json)
passes all required checks: 485 workspace tests, 38 solver controls, all three
end-to-end phases and three rounds of the 33-unit conformance subset. Its longest
job is 368 seconds. This preserves the separate local replay failure and does
not qualify the real-project workload. Configured HTTP transport now starts
initialization asynchronously at daemon bind; its complete corrected local
gate is still pending.
The earlier [missing-fixture failure](../bench/validation/m7-linux-solver-b36-emulated-2026-10-11.json)
remains preserved. The
[installed product build](validation/m7-current-product-build.json) and
[hardened MCP transport smoke](validation/m7-installed-mcp-b36.md) pass their
recorded scopes. The bounded source candidate now builds with all 13 runtime
artifacts and 2,060 vstd obligations, but its original cross-edit test refuses
span provenance for an unchanged function after an unrelated module body edit.
All early qualification controls and complete outcomes pass; later full
human-eval qualification was not reached. See the
[retained source failure](../engine/verus/candidates/decode-ownership/scoped-query-qualification-failure.json).
The candidate remains unselected while the mismatch is investigated.
Complete default standard validation, real-project reader census and both
twofold repair-loop gains remain pending.

Focused controls, source builds, offline profiles and earlier passing suites
establish only their recorded scopes. No timeout or failed run is reclassified.
[Known issues](known-issues.md) links the complete failure index; the
[retained status history](validation/m7-acceptance-status-history.md) preserves
the earlier detailed narrative. [The acceptance guide](bench/m7-repair-acceptance.md)
sets the unchanged required gates and artifact provenance.

Priority order for completing this milestone:

1. Keep the complete workspace gate green, restore complete solver/HTTP replay success and retain real-solver/fault
   evidence, finish the current CLI/MCP suite without changing assertions or deadlines,
   and finish full default standard corpus validation. The cold replay diagnostic
   identifies client construction consuming the lookup budget; separate earlier
   established-transport failures remain unresolved and independently recorded.
2. Build and qualify the bounded source candidate with the same-input lowering
   oracle, independent stock outcomes, adversarial controls and physical budget.
3. Establish genuine Current real-project results and execute the original live
   reader and retained CLI/MCP scenarios with matching frozen product/runtime.
4. Measure all frozen human-eval and Vest repair cycles for three rounds, retain
   spread and resources, and meet the twofold improvement on each catalogue.
5. Publish complete user/developer documentation and evidence; merge only with
   all local acceptance and required CI green. No pending gate is marked done.

## Later waves (from the charter's initial scope)

1. **Caching.**
   - **Done:** key v2; a disk tier, a 256 MiB memory tier and write-behind
     stores (ADR 0011, 0015); serving far-from-limit `unknown` answers
     (ADR 0009); effort recording; fault injection; a shared tier of
     signed entries in a directory store (ADR 0017); optional authenticated
     HTTP(S) reading and publication with a self-hosted server (ADR 0025).
   - **Deferred:** warm solver pools (measured; see below) and the opt-in
     stack-key mode (ADR 0008 update).
2. **CLI.**
   - **Done:** `sail verify`, `sail watch`, `sail serve`, `sail status`,
     `sail cache`, and the MCP server `sail mcp` (ADR 0016).
   - **Done:** `sail bench` delegates to the benchmark binary.
3. **Agent ergonomics.**
   - **Done:** function attribution, the ledger and `--output json` schema v1
     (ADR 0014).
   - **Done:** fragility measurement: `sail fragility`, `sail-bench
     fragility` and the fragility census (ADR 0018).
   - **Done:** exact function scores in JSON/MCP and sequential,
     complete-run `accept-first-proof` portfolios (ADRs 0018, 0020).
     Every winning attempt independently proves the requested scope.
     Racing is deferred; seed successes are never assembled across runs.
4. **Benchmarks.**
   - **Done:** cold, warm, edit, agent-loop and history-replay workloads, all
     local-only (ADR 0013).
5. **Corpus.**
   - **Done:** fast and standard tiers, plus a secondary Verus pin and
     `docs/compatibility.md`.
   - **Done:** the exclusive, strict `rust_verify_test` deep suite and
     optional Singular source-build validation (ADRs 0019, 0021).
6. **CI.**
   - **Done:** a container image, with six fast per-PR checks only
     (ADR 0013).

### Measured: warm solver pools would not pay off (2026-10-08)

The charter lists warm solver pools. We measured their value before building
them, on a vstd run on macOS arm64:

| Run | Wall time | Rust front end | Verus verify phase (CPU, all threads) | Solver (all threads) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Plain Verus | 18.9 s | 5.7 s | 57.9 s | 13.0 s |
| sail, warm | 17.1 s | 5.6 s | 50.3 s | 3.5 s |

- **What's left after a warm cache is Verus, not the solver.** Most of the
  remaining time is Verus's own work: the Rust front end, VIR, and AIR and
  SMT generation.
- **The Linux fast-tier warm run** started a solver for only 26 of 1,526
  sessions.

Warm pools could only shorten that small solver-side remainder, so they are
**deprioritised**. The levers that matter now:
- **The warm Verus frontend** (the charter roadmap item), which may need
  Verus's cooperation;
- **Upstream determinism (VI-0001),** to raise hit rates;
- **Fill cost on slow filesystems:** write-behind stores in the daemon.

## Charter roadmap (designed for, built later)

- Multiple SMT backends.
- Alethe and Carcara certificates.
- A Rust pre-solver.
- Unsat-core pruning.
- Instantiation replay.
- A warm Verus frontend.
- Other verifiers.
