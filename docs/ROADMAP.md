# Roadmap

The project is built in waves. Each milestone ends with evidence: green gates,
conformance results and, where relevant, benchmark data. Work widens only after
the previous milestone is shown to work.

## Initial session (foundation): done, 2026-10-08

See `docs/reports/2026-10-08-bootstrap.md` for the evidence.

- **M0: Workspace and guardrails.** The crate skeleton from the charter, the fast
  CI tier, lints, the AI-authorship guard (hook, CI and agent config), docs, and
  ADRs 0001–0002. *Exit:* both CI jobs green on `main`, the guard rejects an AI
  trailer locally and in CI, then switch to PR mode.
- **M1: Survey and integration decision.** `docs/survey/` covers Verus↔Z3
  internals for the pinned release, prior art, corpus candidates and solver
  behaviour. The pinned Verus is installed via `cargo xtask fetch-verus`. *Exit:*
  an ADR on the integration point, backed by an empirical transcript.
- **M2: Faithful pass-through.**
  - `sail-smtlib`: a byte-faithful parser and printer.
  - `sail-session`: assertion stack, options and the logical state at each
    `check-sat`.
  - `sail-z3` (`sail-shim`): forwards every byte to the pinned Z3, with an
    observation-only tap and transcript capture.

  *Exit:* a toy crate verifies identically with and without the shim.
- **M3: Corpus, conformance, baseline and profile.**
  - Pinned corpus.
  - `sail-conformance` diffs plain Verus against Verus-with-shim.
  - `sail-bench` baseline and generated `docs/benchmarks.md`.
  - Query corpus from shim transcripts, with a profile of solver time per query
    and function and of seed stability.

  *Exit:* zero verdict or diagnostic differences in pass-through mode.
- **M4: Report.** Survey findings, the integration evidence, baseline and
  profile, conformance results, and open questions.

## Later waves (from the charter's initial scope)

1. **In progress.** Key v2 (ADR 0008) and a local disk cache behind
   `sail serve`. `sail-z3` replays replies from it and starts the solver
   lazily (ADR 0011). `sail verify` is in place.
   - Remaining:
     - effort recording and the near-limit `unknown` policy (ADR 0009);
     - fault injection;
     - the warm and edit workloads;
     - cache-on Linux numbers;
     - an in-memory tier inside the daemon.
2. A daemon (`sail-daemon`) with a warm solver pool (`sail-solver`), the shim's
   daemon client, and fault injection.
3. **Done.** Function and obligation mapping (`sail-verus`, `sail-ledger`),
   `sail verify` pass-through, and `--output json` schema v1 (ADR 0014).
   - Remaining: attribution for multi-package workspaces and lib+bin
     packages (VI-0004), and linking diagnostics to obligations.
4. Seed portfolio and fragility scoring (`sail-portfolio`), opt-in and labelled.
5. `sail watch` speculative verification, and the MCP server (`sail-mcp`).
6. A shared tier with integrity checks (`docs/trust.md`).
7. History replay and agent-loop benchmark workloads.

### Measured: warm solver pools would not pay off (2026-10-08)

The charter lists warm solver pools. We measured their value before building
them, on a vstd run on macOS arm64:

| Run | Wall time | Rust front end | Verus verify phase (CPU, all threads) | Solver (all threads) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Plain Verus | 18.9 s | 5.7 s | 57.9 s | 13.0 s |
| sail, warm | 17.1 s | 5.6 s | 50.3 s | 3.5 s |

- **What's left after a warm cache is Verus, not the solver.** Most of the
  remaining time is Verus's own work: the Rust front end, VIR, and AIR and
  SMT generation.
- **The Linux fast-tier warm run** started a solver for only 26 of 1,526
  sessions.

Warm pools could only shorten that small solver-side remainder, so they are
**deprioritised**. The levers that matter now:
- **The warm Verus frontend** (the charter roadmap item), which may need
  Verus's cooperation;
- **Upstream determinism (VI-0001),** to raise hit rates;
- **Fill cost on slow filesystems:** write-behind stores in the daemon.

## Charter roadmap (designed for, built later)

- Multiple SMT backends.
- Alethe and Carcara certificates.
- A Rust pre-solver.
- Unsat-core pruning.
- Instantiation replay.
- A warm Verus frontend.
- Other verifiers.
